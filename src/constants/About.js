  bio:
    "A cadet by nature and a developer by passion, a tech enthusiast, a full-stack Web developer. I have completed my full stack web development course recently. I have good knowledge about 'MERN Stack Technologies'. I also have good knowledge about 'Python and JavaScript' languages. \n\n I don`t like to define myself by work I have done. I define myself by work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.",
